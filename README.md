# mda
This is the __5GZORRO's Monitoring Data Aggregator__ component responsible for collecting, signing and pushing monitoring data, provided by each Resource and Service Provider, towards the Data Lake. As monitoring data is presented over time, it can also be aggregated and made available in a proper manner to perform the desired analytics.

## Production

### Pipeline Description

We tender a confluence page available online describing the intended full pipeline (steps and parameters skeleton). Consult it [here](https://confluence.i2cat.net/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=5GP&title=Monitoring+Data+Aggregator+Pipeline)

</p>

### Deployment Instructions
This section covers all the needs a developer has to get deployment of the production mda component.

#### Prerequisites
For run this component, we need to define some environment variables in file [.env](https://github.com/5GZORRO/mda/blob/main/.env).
Also, it is required to have PostgreSQL installed on the machine. For Ubuntu 20.04, to use the apt repository, follow these steps:
```
# Create the file repository configuration:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'

# Import the repository signing key:
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

# Update the package lists:
sudo apt-get update

# Install the latest version of PostgreSQL.
sudo apt-get -y install postgresql

# If you want to install a specific version, you can use postgresql-version instead of postgresql. For example, to install PostgreSQL version 12, you use the following command:
sudo apt-get install postgresql-12

# When you installed PostgreSQL, the installation process created a user account called postgres associated with the default postgres role. To connect to PostgreSQL using the postgres role, you switch over to the postgres account on your server by typing:
sudo -i -u postgres

# It will prompt for the password of the current user. You need to provide the password and hit the Enter keyboard.
```

#### Deploy components
The components configuration is built in a docker-compose. Since we are handling private packages, the first step requires the authentication of the user to get permissions. So, to acquire these permissions the following command is needed:
```
$ docker login -u <GITHUB_USER> -p <GITHUB_PASSWORD_OR_TOKEN>  docker.pkg.github.com
```
 * **Note:** If it is required to utilize the personal access token and you do not possess that feature, you can see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Then, for build and up the docker compose we have:
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up --build
```
 * **Note:** If you want to deploy only one component, you can use:
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up --build <component_name>
```
### Persistence detail

In case MDA goes down when the reload occurs, it is standard to have data loss (no requests were made to the data source for the period that the component was down). For the still-active monitoring specs when MDA reloads, the next run fields are updated accordingly with the current time and their steps.

## Development

### Pipeline Description

For the development stage, at this point, our focus has been on implementing a primary version of this component including on the pipeline a dummy OSM, a dummy VS, and a dummy component that interacts with a python client responsible to produce data and redirect to the respective dummy Kafka topic.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32877599/110475056-4ee73a80-80d8-11eb-9756-b82e3c162688.png" />
</p>

Currently, our pipeline is composed of five main steps, each one held for:
1. VS sends to MDA a __configuration__ with dynamic variables specifying the monitored metrics 
2. MDA fetches from OSM the __metric values__ 
3. Metric __aggregation__, via TimescaleDB aggregation operation (if the case)
4. __Hash/signing__ data with operator's key making use of SHA256 and RSA algorithms
5. __Inject__ data into a DL Kafka Topic

### Supported Endpoints
The following table displays the endpoints used in the development scenario:

**Endpoint**|**Description**|**Method**
|:----|:----|:----
`http://<IP>:4000/settings`|Enable and send the monitoring spec with the dynamic config variables|POST
`http://<IP>:4000/settings/:id/enable`|Enable a certain monitoring spec|PUT
`http://<IP>:4000/settings/:id/disable`|Disable the current monitoring spec|PUT
`http://<IP>:4000/settings/:id`|Modify the current monitoring spec|PUT
`http://<IP>:4000/settings/:id`|Retrieve all the monitoring specs associated with a given id|GET
`http://<IP>:4000/settings`|Retrieve all the existing monitoring specs|GET
`http://<IP>:4000/settings/:id`|Delete a certain existing monitoring specs|DELETE


### Deployment Instructions
This section covers all the needs a developer has to get deployment of the development scenario.

#### Prerequisites
For run this component, we need:
* Define some environment variables in file [.env](https://github.com/5GZORRO/mda/blob/main/.env).
* Install PostgreSQL database as mentioned previously
* Run the kafka compose with:
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-kafka.yml up --build
```

#### Deploy components
For build and up the docker compose we have:
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up --build
```
 * **Note:** If you want to deploy only one component, you can use:
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up --build <component_name>
```
